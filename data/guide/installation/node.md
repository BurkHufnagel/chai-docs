### Node.js

Package is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install chai

Recommend adding it to `package.json` devDependencies using a `*` as the version tag.
This will ensure that you always have the most recent version after running `npm install`,
which can be especially powerful when paired with a continuous integration tool.

```javascript
"devDependencies": {
  "chai": "*",
  "mocha": "*"
}, "//": "mocha is our preference, but you can use any test runner you like"
```
